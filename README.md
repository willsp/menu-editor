menu-editor
===========

A web menu editor using the TreeNode object.

It uses a new directive I created to make a list sortable. The only dependency is angular 1.2.2. No need for jQuery and especially no need for jQuery UI (I f'n hate jQuery UI).

Click the Add Root button to add a new root menu. There is a gripper on the left side of each item. Just click and drag up and down to reorder the list. The model will be updated as soon as you release the gripper.
